I see you ashine! A dream in Wilderness.
Saw me afire. Ashes now, faded and so lost.
May it not be a mere fantasy but a lead by eternity.
Rugged and worn under a bright Sun.
Darn not the endurance, yet that lost and immaculate treasure.
My solicitude shines for you in my eyes and perpetually in my whole being.
